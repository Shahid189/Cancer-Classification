# Cancer-Classification
Project of cancer classification under Prof Ravi Kothari

Built a decision tree and random forest models to predict whether a given datapoint corresponds to benign or malignant class. Compared the 5-fold cross validation accuracies for the two models.


Plotted a chart depicting the effect of varying the Size(n_estimators) of Random Forest on the 5-fold cross validation accuracy.


Plotted another chart depicting the effect of varying Feature Subset size(max_features) of the Random Forest model on the 5-fold cross validation accuracy. (take atleast 3 sizes)
